# OpenGLSolarSystem
IT356 Project for a Solar System I created using open GL. 

You can use the keys WASD to move around the rendering screen as well as use your mouse to position and translate the camera. 

To run the rendering simply open the EXE file inside the bin of the code.

if you have the required system requirements you will be able to see the rendering and all of its planets.

Additionally the program has 9 spheres to represent our solar system. 8 for the planets and 1 for the sun.

every planet has its own rotation and orbit around the sun.
